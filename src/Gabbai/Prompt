This weekend challenge is focused on adding Object Serialization to our OOP projects and utilizing git.
Step 1: Choose whether you're going to do a new OOP project or refactor an old one
Step 2: Add a git repo to the project (or confirm that you have one already set up)
Step 3: Make an initial commit of your project as it stands (or from the beginning)
git add .
git commit -m "initial commit"
Step 4: Confirm the commit was made by using the git log
git log
Step 5 - beyond:  repeat the git commands: git add .   git commit -m "some message"  as you continue to build your project based on the following specs:
Your project should implement at least 3 classes

Class attributes should be encapsulated (private with getters/setters)

Your manager class should have all 4 CRUD methods implemented

Your manager class should implement saveData() and loadData() methods and your user interface should give the user
an option to save before quitting and to load when first starting the program.

Both methods should serialize and deserialize your class data.
You should strive to have at least 10 commits in your git log by the end of this challenge.
