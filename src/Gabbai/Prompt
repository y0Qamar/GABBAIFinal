git log
Step 5 - beyond:  repeat the git commands: git add .   git commit -m "some message"  as you continue to build your project based on the following specs:
Your project should implement at least 3 classes

Class attributes should be encapsulated (private with getters/setters)

Your manager class should have all 4 CRUD methods implemented

Your manager class should implement saveData() and loadData() methods and your user interface should give the user
an option to save before quitting and to load when first starting the program.

Both methods should serialize and deserialize your class data.
You should strive to have at least 10 commits in your git log by the end of this challenge.
